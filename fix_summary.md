# Audio Buffer Fix Summary

## Problem
The recording wasn't staying active as long as the Alt+Shift hotkey was held because:

1. **Audio buffer overflow**: The recording thread was producing ~344 chunks/second (44100 Hz ÷ 128 samples)
2. **Small buffer size**: Only 1000 chunks = ~3 seconds of audio capacity  
3. **Delayed processing**: Transcription waited until recording finished before consuming the buffer
4. **Dropped chunks**: Buffer filled up and started dropping audio data with warnings like:
   ```
   WARNING - Audio buffer full, dropping chunk
   ```

## Root Cause
The `audio_buffer` queue was being used to duplicate audio data that was already being stored in the `frames` array. The buffer would fill up in ~3 seconds, causing audio loss and incomplete transcriptions.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Audio Storage
- **Removed**: `audio_buffer.put(data)` calls from recording loop
- **Kept**: Direct storage in `frames` array
- **Result**: No more buffer overflow warnings

### 2. Updated Processing Pipeline
- **Before**: `process_audio_stream()` read from buffer after recording
- **After**: `process_audio_stream(audio_frames)` processes frames directly
- **Benefit**: No waiting, no buffer consumption issues

### 3. Fixed Frame Passing
- **T3VoiceTranscriber**: Added `self.recorded_frames` storage
- **Interactive Mode**: Added frame capture wrappers
- **Result**: All modes now pass actual recorded audio to transcription

## Code Changes

### Core Changes
1. **record_audio_stream()**: Removed buffer.put() calls
2. **process_audio_stream()**: Now takes frames parameter  
3. **T3VoiceTranscriber**: Added frame storage and capture
4. **Interactive modes**: Added frame capture wrappers

### Files Modified
- `app/t3.py`: Main fixes applied
- Audio buffer queue size limit removed as no longer needed

## Expected Results
- ✅ Recording continues for full duration of hotkey hold
- ✅ No more "Audio buffer full" warnings  
- ✅ Complete audio captured and transcribed
- ✅ Proper visual notifications throughout process
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

## Testing
The fix eliminates the buffer overflow that was causing early recording termination. Users should now be able to hold Alt+Shift for longer recordings without audio loss.
